# wachr Project Euler Programs
<!-- Vim: set filetype=markdown spell : -->

This is a collection of programs and scripts I have written to provide
solutions to the Project Euler problems.

I am doing this for fun and to demonstrate my knowledge of programming in
various languages. These are some of the languages which I will demonstrate in
this collection:

- Haskell
- Go (Golang)
- Ruby
- *Java*
- Python
- Javascript (NodeJS)
- C/C++
- Clojure

Some languages I'd like to learn to write some solutions in:
- Scala
- Lua
