# wachr Project Euler Programs

This is a collection of programs and scripts I have written to provide
solutions to the Project Euler problems.

I am doing this for fun and to demonstrate my knowledge of programming in
various languages. These are some of the languages which I will demonstrate in
this collection:

- Haskell
- Go (Golang)
- Ruby
- *Java*
- Python
- Javascript
- *ANSI C*

Some languages to learn before I can write something in them:
- Scala
- Lua
- Clojure
- C++
